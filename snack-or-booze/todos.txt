Until a week ago, you were the lead developer at Silicon Valley’s hottest coding cafe, “The Closure Cafe”. You had a nice React app that listed your food items drawing those from a static list of items hard-coded into your app.

Now, though, the cafe has gotten its liquor license and relaunched itself as “Snack or Booze”, and your app needs to change!

x The homepage should show the # of food items (“snacks”) and drink choices (“drinks”)
x The navbar should add a new link, “Drinks”, leading to a page listing the drinks — just like the “Snacks” link leads to a page listing food items.
x The drink listing page should show a list of drink choices, with each being a link to the details about the drink, just like for food items.
x **However**, you shouldn’t solve this by just cloning the ***FoodMenu*** and ***FoodItem*** components — you’d have so much duplicate code! Instead, turn these into generic components that can work with either food or drink lists/items.
- Now that you have more things on your menu, you should add a page that lets site users add either a drink or a snack.
- **Design your app well.** We don’t want to see poor names or see AJAX calls buried in your components. Use good design! Test whatever you can!
- Make sure you **document your code appropriately. Srsly.**
- Make sure you handle not-found pages — if a visitor tries to go to a link that doesn’t work, it should give a friendly 404-style message. If someone tries to go to a drink or food item that doesn’t exist, it should redirect to the drinks or food items listing page.

The app does not need any kind of login or authentication; everyone can see everything and can add new items.
